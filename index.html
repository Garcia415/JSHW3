Create a script that checks for valid input, i.e., that the input is between 0-100 and that, of course, the input are all numbers. If all input is valid then calculate and display the student's final average according to the formula:

            final average = (.5 * hwAvg) + (.2 * midExam) + (.2 * finalExam) + (.1 * participation)

                <p><a href="part4.html">Part 4</a>Computers are playing an increasing role in education. Write a program that will help an elementary school student learn multiplication. Use Math.random to produce two one-digit integers (0-9). It should then display a question such as:

                    How much is 6 times 7?</p>
